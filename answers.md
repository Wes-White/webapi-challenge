Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

Two parts of express I learned about this week is express Router and middleware.

Describe Middleware?

Middelware is code that excutes on a request before the request makes it to the backend. 'Catches it in the middle' Middleware allows us to apply logic to the request to check for an id, or to check if a post is valid.

Describe a Resource?

When designing a RESTful Web API everything is a resource. An endpoint for example would be a resource.

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

The API will return status codes and error messages to let the client know if the request was successful.

How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

We can partition our application by using express Router.
